## About me

I am a second-year PhD student in mathematics at [Memorial University of Newfoundland](https://mun.ca/), supervised by [Eduardo Martínez-Pedroza](https://www.math.mun.ca/~emartinezped/). Previously, I completed a Master of Advanced Study (MASt) degree from the [University of Warwick](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/maths/) and a Master of Mathematics (MMath) degree from the [University of Manchester](https://www.maths.manchester.ac.uk/). 

I am interested in geometric group theory, low-dimensional topology and dynamical systems.
